## Inspiration ☁️:
Our inspiration came from the difficulty of scrolling through job sites and finding the right job postings that matched our skills. Websites like linkedin and indeed have limited filtering functions that make it difficult to narrow down our search. As Waterloo students who are constantly looking for internship opportunities, we decided to take action.

## What it does 💁‍♂️:
Job basket is a a web application that matches resumes with job postings on Indeed. It is an NLP based project that uses semantic search between the resume skills section, and the job descriptions that are webscraped from indeed. The result is a list of links that the user is able to redirect to.

## Challenges we ran into 😳:
- Connecting all of the technologies together (Firebase storage with react and python notebooks)
- Understanding the use case of the Cohere embed api, and implementing it

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 💪:
- Implementing the cohere api successfully
- Learning and connecting different tools
- Making a project flowchart
- Meeting deadlines and overcoming software bugs

## What we learned 🧠:
- Webscraping
- NLP Semantic Search
- What's next for Job Basket
- Adding more job posting websites
- Authentication - saving user data
- User controlled filters
