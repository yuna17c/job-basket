The goal of the projects and\\nservices offered by the company is to greatly reduce the need for expensive solar panels by using tracking\\nmirrors which concentrate the sun’s energy. This is a technology which our team has spent ten years\\ndeveloping.\\n\\nOur first product is an automatic sun tracking dish which powers a Stirling engine and is aimed at the\\n\\neducational market. At present the main sources of renewable energy training for students are websites and\\nprinted materials, which are theoretical and certainly not ‘hands-on’. Our bench-scale product, which involves a\\nlive demonstration with the direct participation of students, trains them in solar tracking, solar energy capture,\\nand its conversion into mechanical and electrical energy. Therefore, our hands-on product lets the students\\nbenefit from direct involvement in solar technology. The sun’s energy is concentrated by means of this\\nreflecting off-centre dish. The Stirling engine, placed at the focal point, then converts this concentrated heat into\\nmechanical work and rotates a fly wheel. The fly wheel finally rotates a generator to produce electricity.\\nOur second product is a solar hybrid PV-Thermal linear Fresnel collector.\\n\\nWe also offer to customers aid in the development of an integrated sustainable methodology for water\\n\\ndesalination and the extraction of sea-salt powder for de-icing and as raw material for production of magnesium\\nand lithium for the use of government and international companies'},\n",

Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.\\n\\nRideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.\\n\\n\\nRideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Our clients include some of the world\\u2019s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Calgary Transit, and San Diego County.\\n\\nHave you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.\\n\\nRideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.\\n\\n\\nRideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
